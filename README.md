Beautiful Cities - Website By Lubna Araman

	I have created this website to tell you about the cities that I am interested in.The information about cities are taken from google, I did not write them. I only created the website according to Project0 requirements.

This website consists of:
* 4 webpages which are:
	1. index.html --> homepage
	2. seoul.html --> talks about Seoul city
	3. valletta.html --> talks about Valletta city
	4. santorini.html --> talks about Santorini city
* A folder that contains all the pictures that I have used in this website. 
* style.css and scssStyle.scss files for styling the website.
